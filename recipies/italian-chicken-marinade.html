    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Introducing your new go-to chicken marinade. 
       Made from just a handful of pantry ingredients.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder,
            and salt together in a shallow baking dish;
            add chicken breasts and turn to coat. 
            Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator,
            4 hours to overnight.
         </p></li>

        <li><p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p></li>

        <li><p>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.</p></li>

        <li><p>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and
            the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-
            read thermometer inserted into the center 
            should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </p></li>

    </ol>
